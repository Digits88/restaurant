A base restaurant and menu item manager.

== Description ==

A plugin for setting up small restaurant sites.  This plugin was created as a simple base for theme authors to build custom restaurant themes.  It also serves as a foundation for other plugins to build from and add restaurant-related features.  This plugin merely handles a restaurant "menu".  In particular, it creates a 'restaurant_item' post type and 'restaurant_tag' taxonomy.  Other plugins should be created to extend the menu functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Uzip the `restaurant.zip` folder.
2. Upload the `restaurant` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
3. In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the *Plugins* section.
4. Activate *Restaurant*.
